                    We love to read but we got tired of spending hours on the internet looking for good free ebooks to read. That’s why we created Book Hub.To make it quick and easy to find those great reads.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                    We post a free ebook at least once a day. We cover multiple genres so that there is something for everyone.The ebooks are free on the day that we post them. If you find one of our listings is no longer free please post in the comments of that post to let your fellow readers know.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Our posts are a mix of editorial and paid. Many of our links contain affiliate codes, which means we receive a small commission if you buy the book (if the book is free, we don’t get anything). The commission has no effect on the price you pay for the book.
                    
                    <br>If you find an ebook you think our Book Hub readers should know about please let us know in the form below. And if you are an author and you want to tell the world about your free ebook fill out the form in the Authors section and we’ll take a look at your book.
